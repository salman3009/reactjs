Three Scenario:
1.passing data from parent component to child component
Example:Form and Table 
//directly bind the state data to props.
2.Passing data from child component to parent component 
//Having state in both component 
//from child to parent we registered the event.
//we can pass data from child to parent using props registered event.
3.Keeping state in central position example app.js 
//from app.js we can pass props to child component 
==============================================
