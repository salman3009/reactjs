Notes:
any where we need to route please start with forward slash:
 navigate('/dashboard');

Inside the login please make it true once everything is successful:
    sessionStorage.setItem("login",true);
	
Suppose you want to trigger after state update we need to use useEffect from react hooks 

Initial load of the component we need to check some condition at that time we need to use useEffect.
===================================================
useEffect:
//it is consists two parameter.
//first parameter is a callback function.You can write your business logic 
//second parameter decides how many time we need to call this callback function.
//in the second parameter if its empty it will call only one time.
scenario 1: when we need only one time function to be invoked in that particular component 
scenario 2:whenever there is change in state 
scenario 3:for multiple state we can use multiple useeffect.
scenario 4: in single useEffect you can pass multiple state parameter.
scenario 5: only state and props can be used inside the parameter.
=================================================
