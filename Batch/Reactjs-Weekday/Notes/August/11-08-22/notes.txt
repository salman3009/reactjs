step1:we need setup backend graphql

step2: we need to install the below package
cmd:npm install @apollo/client
cmd:npm install graphql

step3:
we need to provide grapql data to react application 
import { ApolloProvider, ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from "@apollo/client";
const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: "https://api.spacex.land/graphql/",
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});
ReactDOM.render(
  <ApolloProvider client={client}>
    <App />
  </ApolloProvider>,
  rootElement
);

step4:
 // we need to write the query to bring the data 
 // Before writing query we need to check the accessibility from the backend server 
 //searchQuery method to execute query and it will return three state
            1.success
			2.loading 
			3.failure 
//with success state you can able to access the data according to query provided by you.
