Notes:
1.usestate
2.useEffect 
Step1: 
Two text will be created
step2:
We need to create state because dynamic data.
step3:
write onChange event inside the text box to update the state.
//whenever we update the particular property in state it will overwrite so we need to copyt the existing data.
//whenever you have array and object please use spread parameter to copy.
step 4:
in button attach onclick event and you preventDefault whenever you click inside the form tag.
=========================================
validation:
step 5:
maintain one separate state for validation purpose.
step 6:
//all usestate are async code. We cannot provide any solution which one will run first.
//To avoid this problem we are using useEffect - it will run after the state update.
============================================
step 7:
//after submit button then only we have to the validation. we used one more that is global state.
step 8:
//state will render again only when there is change in data.
//we maintain one more state inside the button because we need to call this state whenever we submit submit 
//to display email and password no we are creating one more separate state.
